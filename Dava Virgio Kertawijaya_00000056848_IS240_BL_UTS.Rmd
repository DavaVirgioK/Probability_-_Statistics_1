1. SUB-CLO-1 Students are able to practice basic R programming (P3) and SUB-CLO-2 Students are able to practice R programming for descriptive statistics (P3) (Weight 30%).
Question 1:
a. Make an analysis about studentsâ€™ IPS and their Years as well as the books they read using boxplot. Make all six diagrams into one big picture (2x3) all together
b. Find the best boxplot for each diagram and change it to green color. 

Answer
#a---------

#import data
library(readxl)
onsite_StudentsIPS <- read_excel("C:/Users/62812/OneDrive/OneDrive - Universitas Multimedia Nusantara/Dokumen/MatKul Semester 2/UTS/onsite-StudentsIPS.xlsx")
View(onsite_StudentsIPS)

#Years siswa diubah menjadi factor
onsite_StudentsIPS$Years <- factor(onsite_StudentsIPS$Years)
onsite_StudentsIPS$Years

#Books siswa diubah menjadi factor
onsite_StudentsIPS$Books <- factor(onsite_StudentsIPS$Books)
onsite_StudentsIPS$Books

#analisis data menggunakan boxplot
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
par(mfrow = c(1,1))

boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Years, main = "IP Semester 1")
boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Books, main = "Hubungan Books dengan IP Semester 1")
boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Years, main = "IP Semester 2", col = c("green", "white", "white", "white"))
boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Books, main = "Hubungan Books dengan IP Semester 2")
boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Years, main = "IP Semester 3")
boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Books, main = "Hubungan Books dengan IP Semester 3")

#b-----------
boxplot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2 ~ onsite_StudentsIPS$Years, main = "IP Semester 2", col = c("green", "white", "white", "white"))


2. Sub-CLO-2 Students are able to practice R programming for descriptive statistics (P3) and SUB-CLO-5 Students are able to combine several R programs to analyze data (P4). (Weight 30%)
Question 2:
a. Find correlation amongst all IPS, 
b. Analysis them using scatter plots, make them into one big picture (1x3) all together.
c. Give green color to the strong correlation

Answer
#a------

#hubungan korelasi semua IPS
cor(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1, onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2, method = "pearson")
cor(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1, onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3, method = "pearson")
cor(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2, onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3, method = "pearson")

#b------
#membuat scatter plot
par(mfrow = c(3,1))
par(mfrow = c(1,1))

title <- "Plot IP Semester 1"
plot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1, main = title)

title <- "Plot IP Semester 2"
plot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2, main = title)

title <- "Plot IP Semester 3"
plot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3, main = title)

#c------
title <- "Plot IP Semester 3"
plot(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3, main = title , col = 'green')


3. Sub-CLO-2 Students are able to practice R programming for descriptive statistics (P3) and SUB-CLO-5 Students are able to combine several R programs to analyze data (P4). (Weight 40%)
Question 3:
a. Analysis for each IPS whether it is normal distribution of not, by using Shapiro-Wilk.
b. Draw a histogram for each IPS, 
c. Change the histogram color to green if it is normally distributed.

Answer
#a------
(ipsms1 <- stats::shapiro.test(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1))
(ipsms2 <- stats::shapiro.test(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2))
(ipsms3 <- stats::shapiro.test(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3))

#b------
title <- "Histogram IP Semester 1"
hist(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1, main = title)

title <- "Histogram IP Semester 2"
hist(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms2, main = title)

title <- "Histogram IP Semester 3"
hist(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms3, main = title)

#c------
title <- "Histogram IP Semester 1"
hist(onsite_StudentsIPS$ipsms1, main = title, col = 'green')
